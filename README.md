# A Toolbox for Common Deep Learning Procedures.
## Introduction
Whenever I do a project, I always have to re-implement everything from scratch. At first, this is helpful because it requires me to really learn the concepts and procedures by heart. However, these chores quickly become irritating and annoying. So I start to create this repository, to store all the useful pieces of code.

## What can you find here?
I organize the codes into core elements (callbacks, components, losses, metrics, optim, transforms, etc.), and applications (vision, sequence, etc.), each having its own elements directory.
## How do I use the codes?
To use the codes here, simply clone this repository and add it to your favourite project. Then do a simple import call, and have fun deep learning!
