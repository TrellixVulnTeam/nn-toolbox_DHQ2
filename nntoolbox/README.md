# Overview of Library
This library consists of the following components:

1. callbacks: Implementation of various training procedures, such as checkpointing model, printing loss or using tensorboard.
2. components: some common components, such as a multilayer perceptron (often used as head for classifier)
3. vision: computer vision-specific components
4. sequence: components for sequential tasks (such as language)
5. transforms: some general data transformation, such as mixup.
